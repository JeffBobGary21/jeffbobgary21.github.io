        <p>We decided to travel to Brooms Head for a family outing.</p>
        <p>The Brooms Head hike is a path that goes from the lookout to a beach. The start of the path is located here:</p>

        <p>The path can be seen on the left side of the map.</p>
        <p>The path goes all the way down to a beach where you could swim or you could climb the massive sand wall to get some great photos, like I did!</p>

        <h2>What I Thought</h2>
        <p>I found it very fun going there with family, it was also great because I was reliving past memories from my year 7 camp.</p>
        <p>I would strongly recommend you going there to experience it for yourself.</p>
